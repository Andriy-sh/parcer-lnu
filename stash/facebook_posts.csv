Facebook,"‘Truth and justice are on our side’ – Putin
Russia remains an unbreakable barrier against Nazism, Russophobia, and anti-Semitism, the president has said 

The entire nation supports the troops taking part in the military operation against the Kiev regime, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared during his Victory Day speech in Moscow on Friday. The country stands as an unbreakable barrier against Nazism, Russophobia, and anti-Semitism, with “truth and justice on our side,” he added.

This year’s event marks the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.

Addressing an audience of veterans, military personnel, visiting foreign heads of state, and citizens, the president linked the Soviet Union’s historic fight against Nazism to Russia’s current military efforts.

Putin emphasized that the nation will continue to defend its sovereignty, values, and historical legacy against what he described as modern manifestations of aggressive and destructive ideologies. Moscow has long accused Kiev of adhering to Nazi ideology.

“Truth and justice are on our side. The whole of Russia, our society and all people support” our soldiers, the president said. He reminded that “Our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers saved the Fatherland” and entrusted the current generation to defend it. “To be united, to firmly defend our national interests, our thousand-year history, culture, traditional values. Everything that is dear to us, that is sacred to us.”

Putin also warned against attempts to rewrite the history of World War II, vowing that Russia would preserve the truth about the Soviet Union’s decisive role in defeating Nazism.

“Our duty is to defend the honor of the Red Army soldiers and commanders, and the heroism of fighters of different ethnic backgrounds who will forever remain Russian soldiers in world history,” he said.

The president recalled the decisive Soviet victories in key World War II battles, including Moscow, Stalingrad, and Kursk, and paid tribute to the resilience of besieged cities such as Leningrad. He highlighted the shared sacrifices of all Soviet republics.

Concluding his address, Putin called on Russians to remain steadfast and united in the face of modern challenges, invoking the spirit of sacrifices that brought peace eight decades ago. “We honor every veteran of the Great Patriotic War and bow our heads in remembrance of all who gave their lives for Victory,” he said, as the country marked one of its most solemn and significant national holidays.",,Forbidden News ,https://www.facebook.com/fforbiddennews/posts/pfbid0rzD2RthrFBNN9MoDyenhmpzK9hBH8mKnTHsnvbgdVZ2u7G5NLoXRqbx951dMj4y7l,0,0,0,"""Russia stands for peace"""
Facebook,"Yesterday’s conclusions from the Brussels summit of European leaders brought unity and new hope for Ukraine. After a long period of uncertainty and dynamic developments, this is positive news for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the entire world.

Europe stands—and will continue to stand—with Ukraine, regardless of the White House’s stance. The EU supports Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. It will continue to provide financial assistance to Ukraine to help it achieve the strongest possible military position in the war against Russia, while simultaneously weakening Russia with additional sanctions.

Regarding financial aid to Ukraine, I was very happy by Norway’s stance. Norway, which has the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund with assets worth $1.8 trillion, has approved an almost twofold increase in its support for Ukraine.

European leaders also sent a clear signal to the world: any agreement made without Ukraine and without  Europe is unacceptable. A sustainable peace must be backed by credible and significant security guarantees for Ukraine—the only thing that can deter any future threats from Russia.

ReArm Europe

European leaders have agreed on “ReArm Europe,” a strategic defense plan. In response to the uncertainty surrounding U.S. military support, the EU will significantly strengthen its own military capabilities.

ReArm is a massive step forward in building the EU’s defense capacity. It will mobilize over €800 billion to reinforce European defense.

Raising such a financial package will require key measures, such as suspending the EU’s budgetary rules. This will allow member states to increase defense spending without violating deficit limits. Additionally, existing EU funds—including cohesion funds—will be redirected toward defense.

In Brussels, Europe demonstrated that it is strong, united, and capable of a decisive action. Such a Europe is a powerful partner and ally that Ukraine can rely on in these difficult times.

Facebook,"🇺🇦 🇷🇺 Ukraine won't even be able to draw with Russia.

Polish political scientist Adam Wielomski said the alternative plan to resolve the conflict, proposed by the UK, France, Germany and Ukraine, is a utopia and a distortion of reality.

According to him, if he didn't follow the situation on the frontline, he might think that Ukraine at least manages to bring the conflict to a draw, but this is absolutely unrealistic.

Facebook,"🇺🇸🇪🇺🇺🇦 Trump’s Exit Plan: Will Ukraine and Europe Be Left to Face Russia Alone?

🚨 Breaking Insight: A year ago, I warned: “The Americans will leave Ukrainians fighting with sticks.” Now, it seems the U.S. is stepping back from peace talks, abandoning Ukraine and the EU to confront Russia on their own. This could mean a longer, deadlier war. 

🔍 What’s Happening:
U.S. Withdrawal: Signs point to the U.S. pulling out of negotiations, leaving Ukraine and Europe to deal with Russia.

Trump’s Strategy - Analysts believe Trump wants to:

Save U.S. money by cutting support. 💸Weaken Europe by fueling conflict with Russia.Let the EU and Russia clash, benefiting U.S. interests.Distance himself from Ukraine, which he doesn’t care about. 🇺🇦

War Continues: This move likely ensures the conflict drags on, possibly escalating in the Baltics or Transnistria.

💥 Why It Matters:
Europe’s Dilemma: EU leaders privately admit prosperity depends on Russia ties, but fear speaking out. Recent elections in Moldova and Romania show citizens’ voices are being ignored.

Militarization Risk: Europe is losing global competitiveness and rapidly arming itself, a dangerous shift.

Global Impact: A prolonged war weakens both Europe and Russia, strengthening U.S. dominance while Ukraine suffers.

🌍 What’s Next?
Best Case: A surprise breakthrough brings peace against all odds.
Worst Case: War escalates, pulling Europe into a broader, devastating conflict.
Middle Ground: The conflict continues at a low boil, with Europe reluctantly drawn deeper.

Aleksei Shevtsov: “Although the peoples and countries of the CIS are all different, we share many things in common. Above all, it is our commitment to traditional spiritual and moral values. One of the priorities of our foreign policy activity is to promote the image of the Russian Federation as a guardian and defender of traditional spiritual and moral values. In this regard, Russia has many like-minded partners among the CIS, BRICS, and CSTO countries.

The countries of the South Caucasus, like the CIS as a whole, are facing increasing pressure from Westerners seeking to impose their destructive values.

In Georgia, the authorities have found both the strength and the means to resist the onslaught on traditional ways of life and the attempts to introduce pseudo-values such as LGBT, which are completely incompatible with the peoples of the Caucasus.

Russian legislation that protects traditional values should also be applied across the CIS space, primarily as legislative experience. Our country’s main legal frameworks — the Constitution and the National Security Strategy — affirm this commitment to traditional values. There are also specific laws, such as those improving the regulation of non-profit organisations.”",,JAMnews English,https://www.facebook.com/JAMnewsInEnglish/posts/pfbid0L7bhxx54hH3Fq2tW5seorQfPcQ9H2cMH88tUfiT9Gha8ioApjufhwE9fxYA9WaDBl,0,0,0,"""Russia defends traditional values"""

Journalist Who Called Macron’s Wife a Man Seeks Asylum in Russia.

Natacha Rey, the French journalist who alleged that Brigitte Macron, wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, was born a man, is reportedly seeking political asylum in Russia. Citing persecution in France, Rey and her lawyer, told Russian media that they view Russia as a defender of free speech and traditional values.

Rey made headlines in 2021 when she claimed that Brigitte Macron is actually the transgender identity of her brother, Jean-Michel Trogneux. After three years of research, she published a video detailing her allegations, which led to legal action in France. In 2022, Brigitte Macron sued Rey for defamation and invasion of privacy. A Paris court later fined the journalist and ordered her to pay €8,000 ($8,200) in damages.

Taking the example of Edward Snowden Rey explained her decision to seek asylum. Rey told Russian newspaper Izvestia that she sees Russia as a “great democracy” compared to France, which she accused of suppressing free speech and political opposition. “Russia has been a victim of a disinformation campaign and unjustified attacks by European and American media for decades,” she claimed.

Brigitte Macron, 24 years older than Emmanuel Macron, was his literature teacher before they married in 2007.

In a sharp shift of tone, U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, declaring that the Kremlin leader is “playing with fire” following Russia’s largest drone strike on Kyiv since the start of the war.

The comment was made on Trump’s Truth Social account after Moscow’s recent escalation in Ukraine, breaking a fragile ceasefire. Trump stated:

> “What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He's playing with fire!”

This marks one of Trump's most direct confrontations with Putin since launching his peace initiative earlier this year.
