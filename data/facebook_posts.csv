Facebook,"‘Truth and justice are on our side’ – Putin
Russia remains an unbreakable barrier against Nazism, Russophobia, and anti-Semitism, the president has said 

The entire nation supports the troops taking part in the military operation against the Kiev regime, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared during his Victory Day speech in Moscow on Friday. The country stands as an unbreakable barrier against Nazism, Russophobia, and anti-Semitism, with “truth and justice on our side,” he added.

This year’s event marks the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.

Addressing an audience of veterans, military personnel, visiting foreign heads of state, and citizens, the president linked the Soviet Union’s historic fight against Nazism to Russia’s current military efforts.

Putin emphasized that the nation will continue to defend its sovereignty, values, and historical legacy against what he described as modern manifestations of aggressive and destructive ideologies. Moscow has long accused Kiev of adhering to Nazi ideology.

“Truth and justice are on our side. The whole of Russia, our society and all people support” our soldiers, the president said. He reminded that “Our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers saved the Fatherland” and entrusted the current generation to defend it. “To be united, to firmly defend our national interests, our thousand-year history, culture, traditional values. Everything that is dear to us, that is sacred to us.”

Putin also warned against attempts to rewrite the history of World War II, vowing that Russia would preserve the truth about the Soviet Union’s decisive role in defeating Nazism.

“Our duty is to defend the honor of the Red Army soldiers and commanders, and the heroism of fighters of different ethnic backgrounds who will forever remain Russian soldiers in world history,” he said.

The president recalled the decisive Soviet victories in key World War II battles, including Moscow, Stalingrad, and Kursk, and paid tribute to the resilience of besieged cities such as Leningrad. He highlighted the shared sacrifices of all Soviet republics.

Concluding his address, Putin called on Russians to remain steadfast and united in the face of modern challenges, invoking the spirit of sacrifices that brought peace eight decades ago. “We honor every veteran of the Great Patriotic War and bow our heads in remembrance of all who gave their lives for Victory,” he said, as the country marked one of its most solemn and significant national holidays.",,Forbidden News ,https://www.facebook.com/fforbiddennews/posts/pfbid0rzD2RthrFBNN9MoDyenhmpzK9hBH8mKnTHsnvbgdVZ2u7G5NLoXRqbx951dMj4y7l,0,0,0,"""Russia stands for peace"""
Facebook,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has revealed that the US supplied a significant amount of weapons to Ukraine in the months leading up to the conflict with Russia. In an interview on The New York Times' podcast, ""The Interview,"" Blinken stated that the US saw the conflict coming and wanted to prepare Ukraine for it.

The US sent weapons like Stingers and Javelins to Ukraine starting September and December 2021, which Blinken claims were instrumental in preventing Russia from taking Kiev and overthrowing the country. However, Russia's leadership has maintained that their goals were demilitarization, denazification, and Kiev's acceptance of a neutral status and abandonment of its NATO aspirations ¹.

Russia has responded critically to Blinken's remarks, with senior diplomat Rodion Miroshnik suggesting that the US arming Ukraine was a pretext for Russia's special military operation.

Facebook,"Deputy Secretary of Russia’s Security Council Aleksei Shevtsov said that CIS and CSTO member states share Russia’s commitment to defending “traditional spiritual and moral values.” Speaking about Russia’s like-minded partners, Shevtsov also mentioned Georgia.

Aleksei Shevtsov: “Although the peoples and countries of the CIS are all different, we share many things in common. Above all, it is our commitment to traditional spiritual and moral values. One of the priorities of our foreign policy activity is to promote the image of the Russian Federation as a guardian and defender of traditional spiritual and moral values. In this regard, Russia has many like-minded partners among the CIS, BRICS, and CSTO countries.

The countries of the South Caucasus, like the CIS as a whole, are facing increasing pressure from Westerners seeking to impose their destructive values.

In Georgia, the authorities have found both the strength and the means to resist the onslaught on traditional ways of life and the attempts to introduce pseudo-values such as LGBT, which are completely incompatible with the peoples of the Caucasus.

Russian legislation that protects traditional values should also be applied across the CIS space, primarily as legislative experience. Our country’s main legal frameworks — the Constitution and the National Security Strategy — affirm this commitment to traditional values. There are also specific laws, such as those improving the regulation of non-profit organisations.”",,JAMnews English,https://www.facebook.com/JAMnewsInEnglish/posts/pfbid0L7bhxx54hH3Fq2tW5seorQfPcQ9H2cMH88tUfiT9Gha8ioApjufhwE9fxYA9WaDBl,0,0,0,"""Russia defends traditional values"""

(via The Gaze, citing Forbes)

Russia has already destroyed 80% of Ukraine’s thermal generation and continues attacks on power grids and gas infrastructure. In this context, Patriot systems remain critical.

🇺🇸 PAC-2s target cruise missiles
🇺🇸 PAC-3s intercept ballistic ones — even hypersonic threats like Kinzhal and Iskander.

Deployed near the front, they downed 10+ Russian aircraft in one month. But Ukraine needs 25–30 Patriot systems to protect major cities and infrastructure — a challenge due to their high cost and logistics.

📌 One interceptor costs $4 million
📌 Full system: over $1 billion

Still, even limited deployment protects civilians and deters further devastation.

This blurs the line between POWs and civilian detainees, subjected to different legal regimes under international humanitarian law, and opens the door for criminal prosecution of POWs for mere participation in hostilities. 

Further, the Mission documented a high number of arbitrary killings and executions attributable to the Russian Federation, occurring both on the battlefield and in detention.

In a sharp shift of tone, U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, declaring that the Kremlin leader is “playing with fire” following Russia’s largest drone strike on Kyiv since the start of the war.

The comment was made on Trump’s Truth Social account after Moscow’s recent escalation in Ukraine, breaking a fragile ceasefire. Trump stated:

> “What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He's playing with fire!”

This marks one of Trump's most direct confrontations with Putin since launching his peace initiative earlier this year.

Facebook,"Make Afrika Great: “Russia Putin sent Special VIP Plane to Pick Capt. Ibrahim Traore to Moscow”
—
Captain Ibrahim Traoré’s arrival in Moscow marks more than a diplomatic mission — it symbolizes a powerful shift in Africa’s journey toward sovereignty, unity, and pride. As Burkina Faso stands tall on the world stage, Traoré represents a new wave of African leadership — bold, independent, and deeply rooted in the revolutionary legacy of icons like Thomas Sankara.

This video explores the significance of Traoré’s participation in the 80th Anniversary of Russia's Victory Day, the rising alliance between Africa and Russia, and the awakening of a revolutionary spirit led by Africa’s youth. From the streets of Ouagadougou to the halls of the Kremlin, a new Africa is rising — strong, self-reliant, and unapologetically proud.

Building on the success of its larger sibling, the AP1000®—which is already operating in China and the U.S.—the AP300 SMR is designed for rapid deployment, efficient modular construction, and reliable long-term performance.

Delivering 330 MWe, the AP300 draws from tens of millions of development hours and over 30 years of licensing experience with advanced passive safety systems. Its design emphasizes simplified operations, robust hazard resistance, and a ""fail-safe"" shutdown mechanism that doesn’t rely on operator intervention or backup power.

Importantly, the AP300 is supported by an established supply chain and proven fuel technology with a four-year refueling cycle. It’s suited for communities looking to enhance grid stability alongside renewables, with the added versatility to support district heating, desalination, and hydrogen production.

By basing the AP300 on real-world, operating technology rather than untested designs, Westinghouse offers a lower-risk pathway to cleaner energy and stronger energy security—backed by an expected 80+ year lifespan.",,,https://www.facebook.com/UzpfSTEwMDA2NDQ1Mzc4OTcyMToxMDk4Mzc1NjkyMzIwODgwOjEwOTgzNzU2OTIzMjA4ODA=,0,0,0,"""Russia brings order and safety"""

Even President Kennedy was prepared to take the U.S. to war with the USSR because they put nuclear missiles in Cuba.  
The difference is that Krushchev and Kennedy negotiated a solution.  
Kennedy had to remove nukes from Turkey and Krushchev had to remove them from Cuba.  

Biden on the other hand refused to negotiate and in fact sent Boris Johnson and Lloyd Austin to tell Zelensky to walk away from a peace agreement that was ready to be signed.  That was just one month into the limited military operation.

The main problem is that people who watch/read Wall Street neocon media believe that Putin is to blame for everything under the sun while Biden, Zelensky and his Nazis are as innocent as lambs!

I suggest reading/watching independent progressive antiwar experts such as Jacques Baud who worked for NATO and witnessed the aggression of Ukraine against the Ukrainian people who opposed the Biden-engineered 2014 coup that installed Nazi leaders.  Baud witnessed the increasing shelling of innocent people and their children.

The CIA has been working with the Bandera Nazis in Ukraine since 1945 to weaken the USSR and then Russia.  
The color revolutions under Bush and Obama were part of that strategy.  The 2014 color revolution was encouraged by VP Biden and other Americans.

US  President , Donald Trump has issued stern remarks directed at Russian President Vladimir Putin, vowing additional measures against Russia concerning the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

 In an interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker, Trump expressed frustration over the lack of progress in negotiations to end the war. He revealed dissatisfaction with Putin's rhetoric about Ukrainian leadership and suggested the possibility of imposing secondary tariffs on Russian oil if Russia is deemed responsible for the continued violence.

Putin, meanwhile, has proposed discussions under the United Nations' auspices to establish a transitional administration in Ukraine. This administration would oversee democratic elections aimed at restoring credibility and facilitating peace talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded with sharp criticism, further escalating tensions.

In 25 years, Russia rose from the ruins of the '90s to a global power with a $6.94 trillion economy:

🔥Fight against terrorism: Putin crushed CIA-backed militants in the North Caucasus, taking out key terror leaders and overhauling governance. The number of terrorist attacks in the region dropped tenfold. Today, the region attracts tens of thousands of tourists.

📈#4 economy: Russia jumped from the world’s 10th to 4th largest economy by GDP volume. Salaries up 15x. Poverty and unemployment at record lows. Life expectancy? +8 years.

🌾World’s largest grain exporter: In 1998, Russia’s agro-industrial complex was at its lowest point in history. Today, Russia is the world's largest wheat supplier.

❤️Restored historic justice: In 2014, Crimea rejoined Russia through a referendum. In 2022, after 8 years of resisting the bandit regime in Kiev, Donbass, Kherson, and Zaporozhye followed suit.

🪖#2 strongest army: Russia’s army rose from the '90s collapse to face NATO head-on in Ukraine. In 2018, Putin unveiled hypersonics and underwater drones. By November 2024, Russia struck a key Ukrainian defense site in Dnepropetrovsk with its cutting-edge Oreshnik missile.

🚨Multipolar world: In his landmark Munich speech (2007), Putin condemned NATO’s expansion and called for an end to the unipolar world. Russia will follow an independent foreign policy, Putin warned. The era of multipolarity had begun.

💥Combating ISIS*: In 2015–2016, Russia dealt a major blow to terrorists in Syria. The liberation of Palmyra — an ancient city ravaged by extremists — became possible thanks to a well-planned operation and the involvement of Russian forces. 

💪Global powerhouse: From India to Iran, China to North Korea and Turkey — Putin forged a web of strategic alliances. Russia planted its flag in Syria with its first overseas base, gained ground in Africa, and flipped its energy map post-2022. Today, Rosatom is building nuclear plants worldwide.

🔥Leader of the 21st century: “What does it mean to truly fulfill yourself? It’s about finding satisfaction in what you do. It’s both the result and the recognition that matter,” Putin once said.

Russia could assist in restoring civilian infrastructure hit during the June attacks, the Iranian ambassador has said 

Iranian authorities believe Russia could help rebuild infrastructure damaged by recent Israeli and US airstrikes, Tehran’s ambassador to Moscow Kazem Jalali said on Thursday.

He cited a strategic partnership agreement between the two nations signed in January. The treaty outlines economic cooperation and the joint fight against terrorism, while opposing what both nations describe as unilateral coercive measures and breaches of international law.

”Russia can play its role in restoring damaged civilian infrastructure, if necessary, as well as being a mediator to help reduce tensions,” Jalali told Russian media.

Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Iran last month, citing concerns over Tehran’s nuclear program. The claim was dismissed by both the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and US intelligence. However, Washington later followed up with strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities before pushing both sides to agree to a ceasefire.

The attacks caused heavy damage to civilian infrastructure and claimed hundreds of lives, according to the UN. The latest death toll, provided by Iranian Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN Amir Saeed Iravani on Thursday, stands at 1,100 people. Tehran’s retaliatory strikes resulted in 28 deaths in Israel, according to local health authorities and media outlets.

During the 12-day war, several countries, including Russia, began evacuating their citizens from Iran. Among those at risk were hundreds of specialists working at Iran’s only operational nuclear power plant, located near the port city of Bushehr on the Persian Gulf.

While the city was reportedly targeted during the airstrikes, the nuclear facility itself remained unharmed. Russia played a central role in building and commissioning the plant, supplying it with nuclear fuel, and retrieving the spent material to minimize proliferation risks.

Tehran has long insisted that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only. Following the airstrikes, it suspended cooperation with the international nuclear watchdog IAEA and expelled its inspectors.

Russia condemned the attacks, accusing Israel and the US of committing a gross violation of international law, and offered to mediate. Along with China, it also accused the two countries of undermining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which guarantees the right of signatories to pursue civilian nuclear energy.

The UN, various human rights organizations, and legal experts have also condemned the Israeli and US attacks on Iran.",,Forbidden News ,https://www.facebook.com/fforbiddennews/posts/pfbid02SQFX7fsUw1s3VhKYQDbKKFjbWVht6AsGzCtSoNJyFGVaMJeePsE4UjNsppLHDLK5l,0,0,0,"""Russia fights terrorism"""

Facebook,"December 5 is the International Volunteers Day which was mandated by the UN General Assembly in 1985. In Russia, the Volunteer Dat was established in 2017.

We would like to thank everyone who participates in various volunteer initiatives and helps to make the world a better place! Your active work, your sincere desire to help is an example for everyone.

Volunteers take part in many projects implemented with the participation and support of Rossotrudnichestvo. On our pages in social networks, we post about these movements: ""Victory Volunteers"", the Russian Humanitarian Mission.

Do you have volunteering experience? Would you like to be a volunteer?

5 декабря по инициативе ООН с 1985 года празднуется Международный день добровольцев. В России с 2017 года он отмечается как День волонтера.

Благодарим всех, кто участвует в различных волонтерских инициативах и помогает делать мир лучше! Ваша активная деятельность, искреннее желание помочь – пример для всех.

Добровольцы участвуют во многих проектах, реализуемых при участии и поддержке Россотрудничества. На наших страницах в соцсетях мы рассказываем о таких движениях: «Волонтерах Победы», Русской гуманитарной миссии.

У вас есть опыт волонтерства? Хотели бы стать добровольцем?

Facebook,"🇷🇺 Russia Showcases Next-Generation Strategic Weapon Advancements

In a powerful statement of technological and military strength, President Vladimir Putin announced major progress across Russia’s strategic deterrence programs. The nation has successfully completed testing of the Poseidon underwater nuclear torpedo, a groundbreaking unmanned system capable of operating at extreme depths and ranges — a true revolution in naval warfare.

Additionally, the formidable RS-28 “Sarmat” intercontinental ballistic missile, known in the West as Satan II, is officially being placed on combat duty, expanding Russia’s global strike capability and reinforcing its nuclear deterrent posture.

Equally significant, Russia has confirmed a successful test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, a long-range weapon designed to bypass modern missile defenses through its near-unlimited endurance.

These advancements mark a new era of strategic balance and signal that Russia continues to invest heavily in next-generation deterrence systems, combining power, innovation, and precision to secure its national defense in an evolving global landscape. ⚔️🔥

They just assumed Hillary Clinton would win the election in 2016 and they would get their proxy war with Russia. The only problem was Donald Trump won. They impeached him for trying to impede their war. 

Here is Lindsey Graham telling Ukrainian soldiers that 2016 will be the year of offense. The neocons in Washington have been planning this war for a long time. They have rejected peace at every opportunity, they don’t want it to end.
